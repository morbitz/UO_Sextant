UO Sextant is A Win Form App created in Visual Studios with Visual Basic.
It is a tool for the classic game, Ultima Online.
This tool allows a player using the "Classic Client" ( as opposed to the enhanced client )
to know their Sextant coordinates, and x and y coordinates, without needing to use an in game sextant.
UO Sextant allows players to mark a location and save the coordinates with whatever name they desire.
They can then ask for directions to that location, and UO Sextant will point them in that direction.

User generated files are created and stored at:
                            "C:\UO Sextant\\{player's shard of choice represented numerically}\\{facet}.txt"

The App will only operate if the Classic Client is running, and it is run with Administrative Permissions.
If the app cannot get a handle on the UO Client, it will self terminate without notification.

There are no plans to make this app available to Enchanced Client users,
as they already have such tools built in to the client.
